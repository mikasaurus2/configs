# mik_configs
My configuration files. Putting them up here in case they're useful for anyone else. :]

## NeoVim
`init.vim` is the main configuration file. I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install plugins.

## ZShell
Install Z shell and enable it as the default shell.

Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

Install [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt.

Install plugins: [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md) and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md.)

Copy the config file

```
cp zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
